<h1><u>Classification of Computers </u></h1>
<div id="mainbody">
<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
</div>
<p align=left> Computer is a collection of hardware and software components that helps us to complete many different task at enormous speed.
It is one of the most powerful and useful innovation in human history.These days, computer are available in many sizes and types. Computer are classified on the basis of working principle, on the basis of size, on the basis of brand and on the basis of model.

<h2>Analog computer</h2>

<p>The computer which is based on continuous data is knoem as analog computer. It measures only physical or natural quantities such as water flow, current and voltage etc. It is used for specific purpose. The accuracy of analog computer is poor. These computers are suited for physics and engineering. Cost is low as compared to digital computer.Examples of analog devices are thermometer, clock, Plesley etc.

<h2>Hybrid Computer</h2>
<p>A hybrid computer is a combination of computers which is capable of processing in both digital and analog signals. This computer's system  set up with cost effective method of performing complex simulations. It accept a continuously varying input, which is then converted into a set of discrete values for digital processing.For example; ECG (Electronic Cardio Graph) monitor of a patient in hospital.</p>
