<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
</div>
<p align=left> Computer is a collection of hardware and software components that helps us to complete many different task at enormous speed.
It is one of the most powerful and useful innovation in human history.These days, computer are available in many sizes and types. Computer are classified on the basis of working principle, on the basis of size, on the basis of brand and on the basis of model.

<h2>Super Comuter</h2>
<p>A supercomputer is the fastest type of computer which perform at a rate of speed which is far above that of other computer which harness immense processing speed so that they are incredibly fast, sophisticated and powerful.This computer have multiple processor and a variety of other technological tricks to ensure that they run smoothly.Its word length is more than 128 bits.<br>
Example:CRAY-3, CYBER 205, PARAM etc   </p>

<h2>Mainframe Computer</h2>
<p>Mainframe is large, powerful, expensive computers used mainly by large company for bulk data processing,commercial data processing and other large scale operations such as bank transaction processing.It is general purpose computing system.It is very large in size with 1000sq.ft approximately and supports large number of terminals, more than 100 terminals. It word length is more than 64 bits.<br>Examples:IBM's ES000, VAX 8000, CDC 6600 etc.</p>

<h2>Mini computer</h2>
<img src:"mini.jpg">
<p>Mini computer are computer that are somewhere in between a microcomputer and  a mainframe computer.This computer are smaller, less expensive and less powerful than a mainframe computer but more than a personal computer.They can support about 50 terminal and require 100 sq. ft area approximately.They are used for scientific and engineering computations, file handling and database management, business transaction processing etc.<br>Examples:PDP 11, VAX 7500 etc.</p>

<h2>Micro computer</h2>
<p>A microcomputer is a small sized personal computer that designed for an individual having microprocessor inside it. It contains a CPU on a microchip, a memory system, a bus system and I/O ports, typically housed in a motherboard.Microcomputer are designed to be used by individuals, whether in the form of PC's, workstations or notebook computers.This computer are useful for entertainment, business purposes etc.<br>Example: IBM's PC, Apple/Machintosh, Dell etc. </p>
