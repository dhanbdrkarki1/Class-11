 A computer system refers to the fully function able system that is integration of both hardware and software. The hardware components of a computers system are physical components that are tangible such as keyboard, mouse, processor, mother board, memory etc. Whereas the software components are logical components that make physical components work such as data, information, computer instruction etc. 
 <dl><dt><mark>Input Unit</mark>
 <dd>It accepts the data or instructions given by the user and it converts the data and instructions from man readable to machine readable code. Some common input devices are keyboard, mouse, scanner, punch cards, a typewriter, reader etc. 
 <dt><mark>Processor/Central Processing Unit(CPU)</mark>
 <dd>Central processing unit (CPU) is the portion of computer system that carries out the instruction of a computer program, and is the primary element carrying out the computer’s functions. The central processing unit carries out each instruction of the program in sequence, to perform the basic arithmetic, logical and input/output operation of the system. A CPU built on a single chip is called microprocessor.<br><br>
 Some of the primary elements of CPU are given below:  
<dl><dt><u>i.&nbsp;Registers</u>
<dd> Registers are the primary memory of computer system. They are mainly used to store data during the time of processing inside ALU. The registers within CPU are special purpose temporary storage locations. The main types of registers are general purpose and specific purpose registers. The important register within CPU is program counter (PC).
<dt><u>ii.&nbsp;Control Unit</u>
<dd>The control unit is the brain of CPU itself. It is situated in side a processor. It control overall operations and devices of computer. There are two types of control units, the first type is called hardwired control unit. The hardwired control units are constructed using digital circuits and once formed can’t be changed. The other type of control unit is called micro programmed control unit. A micro programmed control unit itself decodes and executes instructions by means of executing micro programs. 
<dt><u>iii.&nbsp;Arithmetic Logic Unit</u>
<dd>The arithmetic logic unit carries out as the name suggests. Arithmetic and logical operations on the data made available to it. Basic arithmetic functions which an ALU can carry out are an addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The logical operation which can it can carry out greater than, equal to less than etc.

 <dt><mark>Storage</mark>
 <dd>The computer memory is a data storing devices. There are mainly two types of memory, primary memory and secondary memory. Primary memory or main memory is a volatile memory of computer. As soon as a computer starts, primary memory stores all running applications, operating system, user interface and any other. 
 <dt><mark>Output Unit</mark>
 <dd>When the computer completes its processing task, the result must conveyed back to the users. Information from the CPU converted into an understandable form through output devices. The output of the computer can be presented into different ways, such as softcopy and hard copy. Some commonly used output devices are monitor, printer, plotter, speaker etc.
