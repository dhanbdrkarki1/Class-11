  <h2><center>Memory</center></h2>
  <p>Memory is the storage device of computer that stores data either permanently or temporarily.Memory is the most essential element of a computing system because without it computer can’t perform simple tasks. Computer memory is of two basic type – Primary memory / Volatile memory and Secondary memory / non-volatile memory. Random Access Memory (RAM) is volatile memory and Read Only Memory (ROM) is non-volatile memory.</p>
