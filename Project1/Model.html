<h1><u>Classification of Computers </u></h1>
<div id="mainbody">
<b><u>Introduction</u></b>
</div>
<p align=left> Computer is a collection of hardware and software components that helps us to complete many different task at enormous speed.
It is one of the most powerful and useful innovation in human history.These days, computer are available in many sizes and types. Computer are classified on the basis of working principle, on the basis of size, on the basis of brand and on the basis of model.

<h2>XT Computer</h2>
<p>XT stands for "eXtra Technology" and these computers are the old technology computer. XT uses CUI (Character User Interface) or text based software. They don't have large storage capacity and faster processing speed, so complex calculation and large data processing can't be done.Even the I/O devices used in XT computers are not very flexible and faster. Having processor Intel 8085/ 8086/ 8088 lies under the XT technology.   </p>

<h2>AT Computer</h2>
<p>AT stands for "Advanced Technology" and these computers are the new technology computers. AT uses advanced GUI based software as well as CUI based software. Their I/O devices are interactive, flexible and faster. Because of their high speed processor and large storage capacity, complex calculation and large data processing can be done easily. Having Processor Pentium 80286/ 386/ 488 lies under the AT technology.</p>

<div class="column middle">
<h2>PS/2 Computer</h2>
<p>Ps stands for 'Personal System' and actually these are not totally different models of computers but actually are refinement of faster AT computers. PS/2 model was developed after 1990 and mainly used in laptop computers. So these computers can run even on battery. They have faster and flexible I/O devices and uses GUI based software.</p>
